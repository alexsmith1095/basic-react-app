This is a barebones project that can act as the foundation of any React application. It is simply a blank [React app](https://facebook.github.io/react/) generated using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) precompiling from [node-sass-chokidar](https://github.com/michaelwayman/node-sass-chokidar).

As I'm currently learning React I wanted a clean starting point that I can build upon, rather than go through the tedious configuration every time I want to start a new project. If anyone else can find this useful, even better.

## Getting Started

1. Install <a title="Node.js" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, if you haven't already.

2. Download or clone this repository.

3. Open a command prompt in the project folder.

4. Install dependencies:
```shell
npm install --save
```
5. Start the server:
```shell
npm start
```
Now build you can begin building your application.
